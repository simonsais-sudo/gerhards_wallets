# 🎯 PRIORITY ALPHA WATCHLIST

This watchlist prioritizes the **"Lead Wallets"** identified via stealth discovery and pattern mining. These wallets consistently enter positions *before* the Tier-B influencer marketing wave.

## 🥇 TIER A: THE LEAD SIGNALS (The "Smart Money")
*Trade these signals immediately upon detection.*

### 1. Paulo.sol Shadow Fleet (The "Profit King")
*   **Significance:** Highest historical PnL ($23M+). 
*   **Strategy:** He uses stealth wallets (`paulo.sol 2`, `paulo.sol 6`) to accumulate high-conviction plays before tweeting from his main account.
*   **Alpha Rule:** If 2+ Paulo shadow wallets buy the same token → **MAX CONVICTION BUY.** Hold until he mentions it on X (Twitter), then exit 50%.

### 2. Crypto Gains 15 (The "Early Accumulator")
*   **Significance:** Identified by the Stealth Discovery engine as the #1 Lead entries.
*   **Pattern:** Often enters 6–12 hours before the "Crypto Banter" or "Ran Neuner" wallets.
*   **Alpha Rule:** Buy within the first 2 hours of his entry. You are frontrunning the "Marketing Tier".

### 3. Corne Marchand 1 (The "Cabal Lead")
*   **Significance:** Linked to the SajadAli cabal cluster but enters significantly earlier.
*   **Focus:** High-volatility memes.
*   **Alpha Rule:** High-risk, high-reward. If Corne buys, expect a cabal pump within 24 hours. Exit fast.

## 🥈 TIER B: THE CONFIRMATION LAYER (The "Volume Shillers")
*Do not buy their entries first. Use them to confirm Tier A moves.*

| Influencer | Role | Profitability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Martini Guy TMG** | The "Exit Pump" | Medium (Analyst focus) |
| **Ansem / Ran Neuner** | The "Retail Wave" | Low (You are often entry liquidity) |
| **Eunice Wong** | The "Cabal Exit" | Low (Quick pumps only) |

## 🛠️ THE GOLDEN EXECUTION FLOW

1.  **WATCH:** Monitor `Crypto Gains 15` and `paulo.sol` fleet.
2.  **VERIFY:** Run `/shill TOKEN` in the bot to see if Tier B (followers) are already in.
3.  **EXECUTE:** 
    *   If **ONLY** Tier A is in: **BUY NOW** (Total Alpha Gap).
    *   If Tier A **AND** Tier B are in: Check `/liquidity`. If healthy, **SCALP.**
    *   If **ONLY** Tier B is in: **REJECT.** You are being dumped on.
